This extension adds foldable lists and sections to Trello boards, together with per list WiP limits turning your Trello board into a Kanban system.

Features
====================
- Combine lists and share WiP limit between lists. E.g. "development.in progress" and "development.done" ⇒ combines to one "development" list with two sub lists
- Press ⨯ in the list top right corner to fold it. Press anywhere on the folded list to expand it again.
- Turn cards into collapsable sections with a selected character repeated N times (defaults to double hashes, i.e. "##")
- Add WiP limits to lists by adding it in brackets to the list title, e.g. "My List [5]"
- Remembers view state for boards (can be disabled)
- Select how to visualize lists where WiP limit is exceeded
- Open the extension popup to configure it

FEEDBACK AND SUGGESTIONS ARE APPRECIATED.
